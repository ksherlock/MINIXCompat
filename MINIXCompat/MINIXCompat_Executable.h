/*!
 Loads a MINIX executable.

 Loads a MINIX executable's text (code) and data from \a pef into host RAM, with proper alignment to the MINIX 256-byte "click" size, and performs any relocation the file indicates is necessary.

 - Parameters:
   - pef: pointer to `FILE` from which to load the executable
   - out_peh: where to place the pointer to the new `struct MINIXCompat_Executable` representing the executable, which should be `NULL` on entry
   - out_buf: where to place the pointer to the buffer containing the executable, which should be `NULL` on entry
   - out_buf_len: where to place the length of the buffer containing the executable

 - Returns:
   - `0` on success, `-errno` on error; if `out_pef` or `out_buf` points to a non-`NULL` pointer, those must be freed by the caller with `free(3)`, even if an error has occurred.

 - Warning: Allocation of both `out_peh` and `out_buf` is performed with `calloc()` and is the caller's responsibility to `free()`.
            These should explicitly point to `NULL` pointers before a call, and may still need to be freed upon error.
